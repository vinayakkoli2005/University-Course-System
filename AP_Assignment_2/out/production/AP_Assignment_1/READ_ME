University Course Registration System
----------------------------------------


Introduction
-------------
The University Course Registration System is a Java-based application designed to manage and streamline the process of course registration, enrollment, grading, and complaint handling within a university setting. The system supports three primary user roles:

Students->: Can view and register for courses, track their academic progress, and submit complaints.
Professor->.: Can manage course details, view enrolled students, and assign grades.
Administrators->: Have full control over course management, student records, and handling complaints.
                  This system aims to simplify administrative tasks, enhance user experience, and ensure efficient management of academic activities.


Features
-----------
User Authentication->: Secure login and sign-up functionalities for Students, Professors, and Administrators.
Course Management->: Add, remove, and update course details, including assigning professors.
Enrollment Management->: Students can register for courses, view available courses, and drop courses as needed.
Academic Tracking->: Students can track their SGPA and CGPA based on enrolled courses and grades.
Grading System->: Professors can assign grades to students, which are then reflected in the students' academic records.
Complaint Handling->: Students can submit complaints, and Administrators can manage and resolve them.
Role-Based Access Control->: Different functionalities are accessible based on the user role, ensuring data security and integrity.



Assumptions
--------------


Assumption 1
------------
Student Registration and Course Enrollment:
Step 1: First, sign up as a student and register for desired courses.
Step 2: Then, sign up as a professor.
Step 3: Assign the professor to the courses that students have registered for through the administrator.
Step 4: Log in as a professor and assign marks to students.
Step 5: Students can view their marks, which reflect the grades assigned by professors.



Assumption 2
-------------
Course-Professor Association:
Each course is assigned to a particular professor.
Any professor can view the list of students enrolled in their assigned courses.



Assumption 3
--------------
Hard-Coded Data:
The system is initialized with 5 courses, 3 complaints, 3 students, 2 professors, and 1 administrator.
Additional courses, complaints, students, professors, and administrators can be added as needed through the system's interface.


Assumption 4
--------------
Semester-Based Course Offering:
Each student is assigned a semester during sign-up.
Students can only view and register for courses that are offered in their current semester.
This ensures that students enroll in courses appropriate to their academic level and progress.
